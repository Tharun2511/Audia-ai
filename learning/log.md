**2026-05-17 · Phase 0.1 — How an LLM decides the next token**
- Covered: tokens (BPE), embeddings as learned vector lookup, RoPE positional encoding, attention mechanism intuition (Q/K/V — math marked optional in revision doc), multi-head, causal mask, sampling (temperature/top-p/top-k), autoregressive loop, statelessness between API calls.
- Built: refactored [summarizeTranscript](../src/lib/ai.ts) with system role + `temperature: 0.2` + `max_tokens: 250`.
- **Stuck (well-internalized):**
  - Temperature concept — strong, near-bulletproof answer on Q1
  - Map-Reduce / hierarchical summarization as a pattern — reached for it independently in Q3
  - Pipeline-level architecture of Audia (audio → Deepgram → text → Groq)
- **Fuzzy (needs reinforcement):**
  - The **autoregressive / one-token-at-a-time** nature of LLMs — didn't surface in Feynman, didn't know Q2 ("how do LLMs have conversations"). Re-anchor in Session 0.2 with streaming as a concrete demonstration.
  - **Statelessness** — same gap; conversations as "caller re-sends full history" not yet sticky.
  - **Tokenization + embeddings** — didn't surface in any answer, so depth is unknown. Surface in Session 0.2 via tokenizer demo + cost math exercise.
- **Calibrations applied:** attention/softmax math went over his head; revision doc §1 math sections marked `[OPTIONAL]`. Going forward, default to mechanism intuition + named concepts, not derivations. See [feedback_math_depth.md](../../../memory/feedback_math_depth.md).
